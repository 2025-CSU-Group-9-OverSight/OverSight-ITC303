#  Live System Monitoring and Reporting System
The Live System Monitoring and Reporting System is designed to collect and transmit real-time system metrics from client machines to a centralized server for monitoring and analysis. The system gathers information about active processes, running applications, and resource utilization (CPU, RAM, disk usage). This data is then sent to the server for real-time visualization and analysis, allowing administrators to monitor system health and detect potential performance issues or anomalies.  

This project is crucial for IT infrastructure monitoring, security enforcement, and performance optimization, ensuring that system administrators have up-to-date insights into system activities. The collected data can be used for anomaly detection, performance tuning, and potential security auditing.
