#  Live System Monitoring and Reporting System
The Live System Monitoring and Reporting System is designed to collect and transmit real-time system metrics from client machines to a centralized server for monitoring and analysis. The system gathers information about active processes, running applications, and resource utilization (CPU, RAM, disk usage). This data is then sent to the server for real-time visualization and analysis, allowing administrators to monitor system health and detect potential performance issues or anomalies.  

This project is crucial for IT infrastructure monitoring, security enforcement, and performance optimization, ensuring that system administrators have up-to-date insights into system activities. The collected data can be used for anomaly detection, performance tuning, and potential security auditing.

## Development

**ðŸ“– [Complete Development Guide](./docs/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md)**

### What's Covered

Complete guide covering:
- **Git workflow** and branch strategy
- **Development setup** and installation
- **Conventional commits** and releases
- **Testing** and code quality standards
- **Project architecture** and structure

### Quick Start

1. **Prerequisites**: Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
2. **Install**: `make install` (Windows: [setup make first](./docs/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md#windows-setup-enabling-make-commands))
3. **Develop**: `make dev` (starts NextJS server)
4. **Seed Database**: `make seed` (populates database with template users - requires server to be running)
5. **Commit**: `make commit` (conventional commits)
6. **Help**: `make help` (see all commands)

### Quick Reference

For specific development tasks, jump to these sections:

- [Getting Started](./docs/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md#development-setup)
- [Git Workflow](./docs/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md#git-branch-strategy)
- [Common Commands](./docs/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md#common-commands)
- [Making Commits](./docs/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md#conventional-commits)

## Component Setup

- **Server**: See [Development Setup](./docs/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md#development-setup) (NextJS application)
- **Monitoring Scripts**: See [Python Dependencies](./docs/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md#development-setup) (Poetry setup)

## Database Seeding

The system includes a database seeding feature that populates the database with template data for development and testing purposes.

### Usage

1. **Start the server**: `make dev`
2. **Seed the database**: `make seed` (in a separate terminal)

The seed command will:
- Clear existing users from the database
- Insert template users with predefined roles and credentials
- Return a JSON response with the seeded user information

### API Endpoints

- `POST /api/seed` - Seeds the database with template users
- `GET /api/seed` - Returns current users in the database (without passwords)
