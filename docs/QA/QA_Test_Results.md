## Bug Fixes Documented

### Bug Fix #1: Alert Spam Prevention (ALERT-001)
**Issue:** Alert generation was creating spam during testing due to:
1. **Hardcoded Hysteresis Thresholds**: Clear thresholds (75%) were much higher than test thresholds (5%), preventing alerts from clearing
2. **No Timeout Protection**: Multiple alerts were generated every 5 seconds when usage exceeded threshold
3. **Poor Hysteresis Logic**: Hysteresis was using absolute values instead of relative percentages

**Root Cause:** 
- `HYSTERESIS_THRESHOLDS` used hardcoded values (75%, 80%, 85%) instead of relative to database thresholds
- No timeout mechanism to prevent rapid-fire alert generation
- Clear threshold (75%) > Test threshold (5%) = alerts never cleared

**Solution Implemented:**
1. **Relative Hysteresis**: Changed to percentage-based thresholds relative to database settings
   - Alert at: Database threshold + 0% = threshold
   - Clear at: Database threshold - 10% = 10% below threshold
2. **Timeout Protection**: Added 30-second cooldown between alerts of same type
3. **Dual Protection**: Combined hysteresis + timeout for robust spam prevention

**Files Modified:**
- `Server/lib/websocketDb.ts`: Updated hysteresis logic and added timeout protection

**Result:** Alert generation now works correctly with controlled frequency during testing

### Bug Fix #2: Profile Picture Sidebar Update (UI-003)
**Issue:** Profile pictures uploaded/removed in Settings page were not updating in the sidebar due to:
1. **NextAuth Session Caching**: Session data was cached and not refreshing with database changes
2. **Browser Image Caching**: Same image URLs were being cached by the browser
3. **Fallback to Cached Data**: Sidebar was falling back to old session data when fresh data was null

**Root Cause:** 
- NextAuth sessions don't automatically refresh when database data changes
- Browser caches images with same URLs
- Sidebar component was using `profilePicture || session?.user?.profilePicture` fallback

**Solution Implemented:**
1. **Direct Database Fetching**: Sidebar components now fetch profile picture directly from `/api/account/me`
2. **Cache-Busting URLs**: Added `?t=${Date.now()}` to image URLs to prevent browser caching
3. **Window Focus Listener**: Sidebar refreshes when navigating between pages
4. **Removed Session Fallback**: Only use fresh database data, no fallback to cached session

**Files Modified:**
- `Server/components/standard-sidebar.tsx`: Added direct database fetching and cache-busting
- `Server/components/admin-sidebar.tsx`: Added direct database fetching and cache-busting
- `Server/app/settings/page.tsx`: Removed automatic page reload

**Result:** Profile picture upload, removal, and sidebar updates now work correctly without page reloads
```

### Bug Fix #3: Admin Threshold Management Implementation (ADMIN-001 to ADMIN-005)
**Issue:** Missing admin UI for modifying alert thresholds identified during QA testing

**Root Cause:** 
- No admin interface existed for modifying alert thresholds
- Thresholds could only be changed via database or scripts
- Missing feature identified as enhancement during QA testing

**Solution Implemented:**
1. **API Endpoint**: Created `/api/admin/alert-thresholds` (GET/PUT) with admin authentication
2. **UI Component**: Built `AlertThresholdManager` with comprehensive validation and responsive design
3. **Real-time Updates**: Implemented database integration with cache clearing
4. **Error Handling**: Added comprehensive validation and user feedback

**Issues Fixed During Implementation:**
1. **Layout Issues**: Fixed Alert component CSS Grid constraints causing text squishing
2. **Timeout Loading**: Fixed API response handling for timeout field
3. **Status Badges**: Standardized "High" text and improved readability with white text
4. **Import Errors**: Fixed NextAuth and getDb import issues

**Files Created/Modified:**
- `Server/app/api/admin/alert-thresholds/route.ts`: New API endpoint
- `Server/components/admin/alert-threshold-manager.tsx`: New UI component
- `Server/app/admin/security/page.tsx`: Added threshold management section
- `Server/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`: Exported authOptions
- `Server/lib/websocketDb.ts`: Updated to use dynamic timeout from database

**Features Implemented:**
- Threshold management for CPU, RAM, Disk usage (1-100%)
- Timeout configuration (5-300 seconds)
- Real-time validation with visual feedback
- Status indicators (Low/Moderate/High)
- Change tracking and reset functionality
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Admin-only access control

**Result:** Complete admin threshold management system with 5/5 test cases passing. Admins can now modify alert thresholds through the UI with real-time validation and integration.
