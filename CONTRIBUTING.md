# Contribution Guidelines  

## Branching Strategy  
The main branch will be reserved for releases.  
The development branch will be the main testing branch.  
All new features/bug fixes will be developed and tested in dedicated branches and then merged to the development branch once reviewed.  

## Commit
Commit messages should briefly detail any changes made.

## Testing/bug reporting
