# Contribution Guidelines  

## Branching Strategy

The main branch will be reserved for releases.

The development branch will be the main testing branch.

All new features/bug fixes will be developed and tested in dedicated branches and then merged to the development branch once reviewed.

## Commit

Commit messages should briefly detail any changes made. Any detailed explenation should be in the commit description. 

## Testing/bug reporting

If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue as this repository is public. Contact the project manager or deputy project manager directly.

Testing should be performed regularly in an isolated environment. If a bug is found include a detailed description with steps for replication if able.

## Coding conventions

Code should always be commented to facilitate collaboration between team members.

Functions and variables must be appropriately named.

Any third-party libraries used should be researched and examined for performance and security before incorporation.
