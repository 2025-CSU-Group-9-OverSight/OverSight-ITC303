# Alert UI System - UI Team Implementation

## Overview
This system handles the **display and management** of alerts generated by the database team. The UI team is responsible for:

1. **Displaying alerts** from the database
2. **Acknowledging alerts** (updating status in database)
3. **Filtering and searching** alerts
4. **Real-time updates** when new alerts arrive

## Architecture
- **Database Team**: Generates alerts based on monitoring data and thresholds
- **UI Team**: Displays alerts and handles user interactions
- **API**: Simple CRUD operations for alert display and status updates

## API Endpoints

### GET /api/alertLog
Retrieve alerts with optional filtering:
- `?status=active` - Filter by status
- `?severity=high` - Filter by severity  
- `?deviceName=D_Stin` - Filter by device
- `?limit=50&page=1` - Pagination

### PUT /api/alertLog?id={alertId}
Update alert status (acknowledge/resolve):
```json
{
  "status": "acknowledged",
  "acknowledgedBy": "user@email.com"
}
```

### DELETE /api/alertLog?id={alertId}
Delete an alert (if needed)

## Alert Status Flow
1. **Active** → **Acknowledged** (user clicks "Acknowledge")
2. **Acknowledged** → **Resolved** (user clicks "Resolve")

## UI Components
- **AlertsPage**: Main alerts display with filtering
- **AlertCard**: Individual alert display with actions
- **AlertFilters**: Status and severity filtering
- **Real-time updates**: WebSocket integration for live alerts

## Database Schema (Expected)
```typescript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  id: string,
  type: string,           // cpu_high, memory_high, etc.
  severity: string,       // low, medium, high, critical
  status: string,         // active, acknowledged, resolved
  title: string,
  description: string,
  deviceName: string,
  timestamp: Date,
  acknowledgedBy?: string,
  acknowledgedAt?: Date,
  resolvedAt?: Date,
  metadata?: object
}
```

## Integration Notes
- Alerts are automatically generated by the database team
- UI polls for new alerts or uses WebSocket for real-time updates
- All alert creation/modification logic is handled by database team
- UI focuses purely on display and user interaction
